Due to the pandemic, many people experienced unexpected long quarantines/isolations during the past one and half year. Now life is finally getting back to normal, however most people are facing mild to heavy depression, social anxiety disorder and other mental issues. There are certainly many mental health providers to users, however the procedure takes a long time and is complicated. The wait time to see a psychological counselor or psychologist could be inspiringly long. Now peopleâ€™s lives are fast-paced, seeing a mental health provider could be an-easy thing to do. Schedules are full, no matching time slot to see a doctor could be the reason, plus money issue. The project that I want to develop is to provide users with real time mental health services online and talk to someone who could be a patient or a provider through this website anytime. Many people want to get mental health services but cannot because of a full daily schedule, long waiting time and limited budget. The project is designed to solve these problems. The website will provide only virtual mental service, users can choose real time virtual conversation or appointments for other times virtually as well. The goal of this website is to encourage people to face/solve their mental issues and to get help for it. In that way, we can create a better and healthier society. The website will also provide anonymous chatting service to other patients or mental health providers. The whole service will be operating virtually and developed with chatbox and video chat features.
